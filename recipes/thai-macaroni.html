    <p><h2>A parallel to Italian pasta dishes with a Thai twist</h2></p>
    
    <p>The Thai Macaroni dish is a street vendor favorite wherever you go in Bangkok. 
        It is derived from what Thai people considered a western pasta dish.
        The big difference is that the outstanding ingredient in Thai Macaroni is the Thai Sriracha sauce
        that gives the recipe its spicy kick and tanginess. </p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Sriracha hot sauce </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Golden Mountain sauce</li>
            <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
            <li>¼ tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>225 g (half a pound) short tube pasta</li>
            <li>15 medium sized shrimp</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup carrots, diced</li>
            <li>Half an onion, sliced</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>2 Green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul></p>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li> Heat a pot of water for cooking the pasta over high heat. 
                Add salt (1 teaspoon for every 1 litre of water) and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li> While you wait for the water to boil, mix together ketchup, sriracha, 
                Golden Mountain sauce, sugar and white pepper, stir to mix well. 
                Prep all other ingredients and have them ready to go before you cook the pasta.</li>
            <li> In a wok, add a little vegetable oil just to coat the bottom and heat over medium high heat. 
                Add shrimp, sear until they are browned on one side, flip them and cook the other side until done. 
                Remove from pan and set aside. </li>
            <li>Let the pan cool down a little bit. Add a little more vegetable oil, butter, and garlic and turn the heat 
                back on to medium. Saute the garlic until the butter browns slightly. Add onions and carrots and cook, 
                stirring, constantly, for 1 minute if you like your carrot and onion still crunchy; 
                if you like them soft, cook them longer. </li>
            <li>Push the carrots and onions aside, then add the eggs to the empty space. Break the yolk and stir 
                the yolks to mix with the whites just slightly, to create a marbling effect. Let the eggs set about 
                70%, then toss it with the carrots and onions. The next thing to add is the pasta, and your pasta should 
                be a few minutes from being done at this point, so turn off the wok, and wait till pasta is done. 
                (If you're taking a little longer and your pasta is done before you're ready to add it, don't panic! 
                Just turn off the wok, go drain the pasta and come back to the wok and carry on. It'll be fine.)</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is done, drain, shaking the colander well to make sure no pasta water is lodged inside the pasta tubes. 
                Add pasta to the wok, add the sauce, turn the heat back on to medium high and toss until the pasta is coated in the sauce.
                Add tomatoes and green onions. Toss to heat the tomatoes and soften them slightly. 
                Remove from heat and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
