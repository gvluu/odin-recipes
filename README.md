My first recipe website for practice via TOP. 
Reminded to use "git add ." and "git commit"

Here's a breakdown of what I did:
    1. Create a new folder in terminal under "repos" directory
    2. Create Git repository via Github. REMEMBER to check box that adds README.md!
    3. Enter "git clone" in terminal w/ the SSH repository link from Github
    4. Set up README.md to explain project, as I am doing now
        a. can use "code ." to open repository in a new window
        b. add content
        c. go back to original terminal (Ctrl + `)
        d. type "git status" to see red, which indicates not yet staged or committed
        e. type "git add README.md"
        f. check git status again to see green, which indicates it is now staged
        g. type "git commit -m "______"" with what changes were made to get your snapshot submitted
        h. type "git log" to check that commit was saved
        i. type "git push origin main" to send it all to Github. Git status should now say "Nothing to commit, clean"
    5. Create files
    6. Add boilerplates
    7. Add content: head, body, links, images, etc.
    8. Go back to root directory
    9. Type "git add ." for everything in current directory to be staged
    10. Type "git commit -m "_______" to submit snapshot
    11. Check git status!
